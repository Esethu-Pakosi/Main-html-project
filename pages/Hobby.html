      In my spare time, coding became more than a hobby it became an adventure.
      Hackathons turned into exhilarating battlegrounds where innovation
      thrived, and collaboration with like-minded enthusiasts fueled my
      competitive spirit. Online coding bootcamps further enriched my skills,
      turning theoretical knowledge into hands-on mastery. The pinnacle of my
      journey was securing second place in a GirlCode hackathon 2023, a
      testament to the power of dedication and passion in the tech world. Yet,
      coding is not a solo endeavor. Engaging with a vibrant community,
      collaborating on projects, and sharing insights have been the companions
      on this thrilling quest. Join me on this condensed coding odyssey a story
      of learning, innovation, and triumph in the dynamic world of coding.I love
      reading some books and I love to go to the beach more especially now that
      it's summer.
